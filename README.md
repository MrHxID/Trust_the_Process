ACHTUNG!!!

Please note that the rules have not yet been peer-reviewed and may change in the future.

These are the rules of the "Process Presentation Game" (name is subject to change):

1.  The participants have to agree on a preparation time, e.g. 1h. The time span
    has to be decided before the topics are selected.
2.  Each participant chooses a topic that another participant has to prepare
    a presentation for. The assignment of who selects a topic for whom is made
    by this program (see table "Selector -> Presenter").
3.  The slides should look as unprofessional as possible. The more brain cells are
    lost per slide, the better. Any means of creating eyesores is allowed
    and even encouraged.
4.  After the preparation time is over, the participants present their talks in the
    order given by this programm. The talk should generally be held in a way as if
    you were presenting a serious topic. The goal is to create dry humour and spontaneous
    jokes that the audience does not expect.
5.  Any participant who is unwilling to present the topic assigned to them will have their
    bigman-certificate revoked until they can deliver a satisfactory talk.
